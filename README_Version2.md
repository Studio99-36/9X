# Studio 9X - Creative Photo Studio Website

This is a minimal and modern photo studio website for Studio 9X, built with pure HTML and CSS.  
It is ready for deployment on GitHub Pages!

## Features

- Custom logo (replace `src="image1"` in `index.html` with your actual filename if you move the image)
- About Me section
- Gallery (add or replace images)
- Contact form (uses `mailto:` â€” you can upgrade to a backend later)
- Social media links (replace `#` with your actual URLs)
- Fully responsive & easy to customize

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Replace gallery photos:**  
   Update the `<img src="...">` in the Gallery section with your own image URLs or file paths.
3. **Update the contact form:**  
   Change `action="mailto:your@email.com"` to your actual email.
4. **Update social links:**  
   Replace `#` in the social media `<a href="#">` with your real profiles.
5. **About Me section:**  
   Edit the text in the About section as you prefer.
6. **Logo:**  
   Your logo is included as `image1` in this environment. If you use your own repository, save your logo (preferably as `logo.png`) in the project folder and set  
   `<img src="logo.png" alt="Studio 9X Logo">` in the HTML.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Push all files to your GitHub repository.
2. In your repo settings, enable GitHub Pages (set the source branch to `main` or `master`).
3. Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

## Customization

- **Colors:**  
  Edit the `:root` variables in `styles.css` to change the color scheme.
- **Fonts:**  
  You can add Google Fonts or custom fonts as desired.
